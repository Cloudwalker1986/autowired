# Autowired
With the new Autowired component you have now the possibility to easily load all your dependencies during construction of your main object.  

## There are so many other DIC solutions available why I should use this one?

The main idea of this component is to be stand alone and not depending of any other third party component in order to be ready for use.
Other components are as well great, and we used a lot of different components already but do you know how many other components are needed in order to run a normal DIC container and even you have to sometimes maintain several files in order to keep the overview.
The main purpose for this component is to keep your live simple and easy and donÂ´t get headache and get lost in files or complex definitions.

## Required third party dependencies

### Runnable requirements:

In order to use this component in a production system you have to run at least PHP version 8.0.*

### Development requirements
As dev requirement, if you want to contribute, phpunit version 9.4.* is required.

## Features of Autowired component

- Easy dependency injection without define your constructor
- Specify if your required dependency can be a shared instance or create everytime a new instance of the dependency.
- Easy to mock autowired object for your test purpose.
- Dependency injection using an interface


## How to use it ?
```
class Example {
    
    use AutowiredHandler;

    #[Autowired]  // Cached object should be used
    private Foo $foo;

    #[Autowired(false)] // Cached object should not be used
    private DateTime $dateTime;   
}

$example = new Example();
var_export($example);
```
Output
```
AutowiredTest\Cases\Autoload\Example::__set_state(array(
   'foo' => 
  Foo::__set_state(array(
  )),
   'dateTime' => 
  DateTime::__set_state(array(
     'date' => '2020-12-03 12:25:09.197889',
     'timezone_type' => 3,
     'timezone' => 'UTC',
  )),
))
```

## How to inject a class but using an interface?

With version 0.0.4 we introduce a new parameter for the Autowired class: $concreteClass
Specify this parameter directly or full fill non mandatory parameters. Take a look to the example below.

```
class Bar
{
    use AutowiredHandler;

    #[Autowired(concreteClass: Foo::class)]
    private FooInterface $foo;

    #[Autowired(cachingAllowed: true, concreteClass: Foo::class)]
    private FooInterface $foo;

    #[Autowired(false, Foo::class)]
    private FooInterface $foo;
}
```

## How to mock classes when they will be autowired?

Actually there are two possibilities.

1. Define a constructor of your main class but ensure that all the parameters which could be autoloaded are not mandatory. The Autowired component will only try to load the related objects only when the property has his initial value (null). Please take a look to the example
   
```
class WithConstructor
{
    use AutowiredHandler;

    #[Autowired]
    private ?Foo $foo;

    #[Autowired]
    private ?Bar $bar;

    public function __construct(?Foo $foo)
    {
        $this->foo = $foo;
        $this->autowired();
    }

    public function getFoo(): ?Foo
    {
        return $this->foo;
    }
}

Meanwhile in the test method do the following

public function autoloadWithMockedClassAndConstructor(): void
{
    $mockedClass = $this->getMockBuilder(Foo::class)
        ->getMock();

    $mainClassWithMockedObject = new WithConstructor($mockedClass);

    static::assertNotEquals($mockedClass::class, $mainClassWithMockedObject->getFoo()::class);
}
```


2. With version 0.0.3 is it possible to use the Autowired ServiceCache in order to declare your mock instance and then provide the class name as a key to the service cache when now the original class will be autowired the assigned value will be your mock instance. Please take a look to the example below.

```
class WithNoConstructor
{
    use AutowiredHandler;

    #[Autowired]
    private Foo $foo;

    #[Autowired]
    private Bar $bar;

    public function getFoo(): Foo
    {
        return $this->foo;
    }

    public function getBar(): Bar
    {
        return $this->bar;
    }
}

Meanwhile in the test method to the following

public function autoloadWithMockedClassAndWithoutConstructor(): void
{
    $mockedClass = $this->getMockBuilder(Foo::class)
        ->getMock();

    $autowiredServiceCache = CachingService::getInstance();
    $autowiredServiceCache->store($mockedClass, Foo::class);
    $mainClassWithMockedObject = new WithNoConstructor();

    static::assertEquals($mockedClass::class, $mainClassWithMockedObject->getFoo()::class);
    static::assertNotEquals(Foo::class, $mainClassWithMockedObject->getFoo()::class);
    static::assertEquals(Bar::class, $mainClassWithMockedObject->getBar()::class);
    CachingService::getInstance()->flushCache();
}
```

## Workaround
Currently, the trait AutowiredHandler is overwriting the construct method of the class where you want to use the autowired component.
If you still need the original constructor due to pre operation before the instance got back assigned to your variable than you need to call first $this->autowired().

Take a look to the example:
```
class Example {
    
    use AutowiredHandler;

    #[Autowired]  // Cached object should be used
    private UserService $userService;   
    
    private array $users;
    
    public function __construct() 
    {
        $this->autowired();
        $this->users = $this->userService->getAll();
    }
}
```
